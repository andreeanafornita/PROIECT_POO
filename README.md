Note: The program saves all the data (events/locations/tickets) in the folder called "data";

Note: If you want to run the program with the CreateLocationsAndEvents command file you need to first delete the "data\locations" and "data\events" folder.

If you want a clean run of the program, delete the data folder and run the command files in this order:
1. CreateLocationsAndEvents
2. GenerateTickets
3. UseAndCheckTickets - need to be updated with valid tickets IDs
