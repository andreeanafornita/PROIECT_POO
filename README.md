# PROIECT_POO
## Getting Started

**Note:** The program stores all data (events, locations, and tickets) in the "data" folder.

**Important:** If you wish to execute the program using the `CreateLocationsAndEvents` command file, it's essential to first remove the "data\locations" and "data\events" folders.

For a smooth and clean execution of the program, follow these steps:

1. Delete the entire "data" folder.
2. Run the command files in the specified sequence:
   - `CreateLocationsAndEvents`
   - `GenerateTickets`
   - `UseAndCheckTickets` *(Please note that this file requires an update with valid ticket IDs)*.

This process will ensure a fresh start and allow you to experience the program without any issues.

Happy exploring!
